# DistributionofWealthMPC 
The results of the paper [The Distribution of Wealth and the MPC](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE694) now generated in an updated repository using a more modern version of HARK, [DistributionOfWealthMPC](https://github.com/econ-ark/DistributionOfWealthMPC). Any followup work should build on the updated code in that repository.

You should be able to reproduce all the results using the `reproduce.sh` script.
